# 🌐 MERN Stack Projects

Welcome to my **MERN Stack Projects** repository! 🚀  
This repo is a collection of small to medium-sized web projects built while I'm learning and experimenting with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

---

## 🧠 About
I'm currently in the process of improving my full-stack development skills — learning and practicing:

- **React.js** (and sometimes **Vanilla JavaScript** for fundamentals)
- **Node.js + Express** for backend APIs
- **MongoDB** for database management
- Exploring **Next.js** to understand server-side rendering and modern React architecture

This repository is a personal learning space to experiment, break things, fix them, and keep improving every day 😄
